A 23andMe test reports that an individual is 2% French. What is a potential issue with this claim?
*a. A genetic definition of “French” does not exist, as genetic signatures in French people today are different from those in French people 1,000 years ago.
b. 23andMe results have no actual scientific basis.
c. There are no genetic signatures unique to any human population.
d. The report cannot be scientifically founded, as no French genomes have ever been sequenced.

Which of the following statements best explains the significance of the completion of the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) Project?

b. The T2T Project confirms the findings of the Human Genome Project.
c. Telomeres are proteins that affect how genes are expressed, so the T2T Project gives additional information about the genome.
d. The T2T Project provided the first-ever insight into the composition of telomeres.

Which of the following is the best reason that codons contain three nucleotides each?
*a. If there were only two nucleotides in each codon, then there would not be enough combinations to code for all of the standard amino acids.
b. Three nucleotides is more than enough to code for all of the standard amino acids, but the excess allows for “wiggle room” in translation.
c. Amino acids are synthesized into proteins three-at-a-time.
d. One nucleotide comes from each of the leading strand, lagging strand, and RNA polymerase during transcription.

Which of the following is the best reason that ribosomes are necessary for cellular function?
*a. Ribosomes facilitate the binding of tRNA anticodons to mRNA codons.
b. Ribosomes are not necessary, as evidenced by the fact that some cells do not have any ribosomes.
c. Ribosomes are necessary for the transcription of mRNA.
d. Because they contain RNA, ribosomes encode unique genetic information that is used during translation.
