*Moore’s law explains the exponential increase in humanity’s technological development.
Moore’s law predicts that, in the future, sequencing a human genome will be free.
Moore’s law shows how computational advances have outstripped advances in genome sequencing.

Which of the following statements best supports the claim that there is no biological basis for race?
*Genetic variation within human populations is greater than genetic variation among human populations.
Human race is primarily determined by geography.
Genetic variation within human populations is less than genetic variation among human populations.
All human populations are genetically identical.

A 23andMe test reports that an individual is 2% French. What is a potential issue with this claim?
*A genetic definition of “French” does not exist, as genetic signatures in French people today are different from those in French people 1,000 years ago.
23andMe results have no actual scientific basis.
There are no genetic signatures unique to any human population.
The report cannot be scientifically founded, as no French genomes have ever been sequenced.

Which of the following statements best explains the significance of the completion of the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) Project?
*The Human Genome Project only sequenced approximately 92% of the human genome, while the T2T project sequenced 100% of the human genome.
The T2T Project confirms the findings of the Human Genome Project.
Telomeres are proteins that affect how genes are expressed, so the T2T Project gives additional information about the genome.
The T2T Project provided the first-ever insight into the composition of telomeres.

What does the “A” in DNA stand for?
*acid
adenine
adaptive
amine

Which of the following methods is an example of next-generation sequencing?
*Illumina dye sequencing
Maxam–Gilbert sequencing
Sanger sequencing
microhole sequencing

Which of the following types of proteins help DNA to form chromosomes?
*histones
phosphate groups
ribosomes
transcription factors

Which of the following examples violates the central dogma of molecular biology?
*A retrovirus, like HIV, uses reverse transcriptase to turn its RNA into DNA.
RNA polymerase I transcribes ribosomal RNA from DNA.
An amino acid chain is formed according to instructions encoded by an mRNA molecule.
Ribosomes in bacteria use an mRNA sequence to synthesize proteins.

Which of the following is the best reason that codons contain three nucleotides each?
*If there were only two nucleotides in each codon, then there would not be enough combinations to code for all of the standard amino acids.
Three nucleotides is more than enough to code for all of the standard amino acids, but the excess allows for “wiggle room” in translation.
Amino acids are synthesized into proteins three-at-a-time.
One nucleotide comes from each of the leading strand, lagging strand, and RNA polymerase during transcription.

Which of the following is the best reason that ribosomes are necessary for cellular function?
*Ribosomes facilitate the binding of tRNA anticodons to mRNA codons.
Ribosomes are not necessary, as evidenced by the fact that some cells do not have any ribosomes.
Ribosomes are necessary for the transcription of mRNA.
Because they contain RNA, ribosomes encode unique genetic information that is used during translation.

Which of the following does NOT support the claim that the traditional notion of a gene is antiquated?
*Genes are barely responsible for organisms’ phenotypes.
A single gene can produce different proteins via alternate splicing.
Enhancers for a given gene may be located far away from its coding region.
Epigenetic effects, which are not encoded in the genome, influence how a gene gets expressed within a cell.

Which of the following is the best reason that the study of epigenetics is important?
*Epigenetic effects have strong influences on how genes are expressed.
Epigenetics is an antiquated pseudoscience that promotes scientific racism.
Epigenetic effects are never inherited, and are thus independent of genotype.
There are currently no good methods for observing epigenetic modifications to DNA.

Why do we care about SNPs?
*SNPs are very easy to detect.
SNPs are always correlated with phenotype.
The function of an allele is entirely determined by which SNPs it contains.
Manhattan plots for visualizing GWAS results look super cool.

Which of the following phenomena most directly causes correlations among SNPs?
*Physical linkage during chromosomal crossover.
Associations between SNPs and phenotypes found via GWAS studies.
The difference between sex chromosomes and autosomal chromosomes.
Random chance with no underlying biological reason.

What does it mean for genotype to explain 80% of variation in a given trait?
*80% accuracy can be achieved by a statistical model that predicts trait value from genotype.
80% of variation in that trait is determined by the environment.
80% of ancestors of an organism with that trait also had that trait.
80% of all organisms that have been genotyped have that trait.

What does it mean for a SNP to be placed high up on a Manhattan plot representing a GWAS study?
*The correlation between that SNP and a given trait is statistically significant.
The correlation between that SNP and a given trait is statistically insignificant.
That SNP causes a given trait.
A given trait causes that SNP.

Which of the following statements best explains the assertion that we are all mutants?
*Every genome contains mutations causing it to vary from the “consensus” genome.
Every nucleotide is a SNP.
All organisms exhibit phenotypic mutation in addition to genotypic variance.
Mutations are so rare that very few humans have them; when no one is a mutant, everyone is a mutant.

Which of the following statements best explains the assertion that GWAS hits are like the stars?
*The number of associations established between genotype and phenotype by GWASs increases linearly with the number of genomes sampled.
The number of associations established between genotype and phenotype by GWASs decreases linearly with the number of genomes sampled.
The numbers of SNPs in the human genome and stars in the universe are roughly equivalent.
Once we reach a certain sample size of genomes, it becomes difficult to find additional SNPs.

Why are monozygotic (MZ) twins especially likely to exhibit the same traits?
*The genotypes of two MZ twins are nearly identical.
Even though many MZ twin pairs are raised in the same environment, their genotypes differ greatly.
All MZ twins are raised in the same environment.
MZ twins learn traits from each other.

Which of the following statements is an example of genetic determinism?
*Homosexuality is entirely determined by a “gay gene.”
There are strong correlations between geography and genotype in human populations.
Academic success is entirely determined by the quality of education received.
Smoking causes genetic mutations that lead to cancer.

What does it mean for a genotype to be correlated with a trait?
*Organisms with certain genotypes are more likely to exhibit certain traits.
The trait causes the genotype.
The alleles in the genotype cause the trait.
All GWASs will assign low p-value to the SNPs in the genotype.
